I'm excited to sharpen my coding skills in this class so I can enter the job market with confidence. I'm in an interesting situation-- I'm a senior graduating this spring with a major in Economics and minor in Analytics. I discovered data science in the middle of my degree and it was too late to switch to a Data Analytics major and still graduate on time, so instead I added the minor and I've been taking extra coding/data science classes as electives. I may be the only person crazy enough to take this class as an elective during my last semester of college (and risk my 4.0 GPA), but I'm very excited for the challenge.
